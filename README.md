# DDPM
A new framework for causal inference in the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) are explored. The forward process involves adding random noise at each step, which is a key component of how the model enables random sampling from small set of data. For instance, AI adoption is obviously not randomly assigned across industries or locations.
