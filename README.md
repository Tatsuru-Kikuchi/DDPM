# DDPM
A new framework for causal inference in the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) are explored. The forward process involves adding random noise at each step, which is a key component of how the model enables random sampling from small set of data. For instance, AI adoption is obviously not randomly assigned across industries or locations.

There is little formal discussion of identification or potential data generating processes. In evaluating the causal inference, is becomes a problem if the treatment effect is randomly assigned across all confounders.

For example, recent article (https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.045302) explored whether diffusion models can enhance parameter inference by augmenting small datasets. 

We apply those DDPM based generative AI model for causal inference, especially for random sampling from a small data set in Economics.
